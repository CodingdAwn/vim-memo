*memo.txt* 很多时候总是忘记一些变量的意思 
我就需要打开对应的官网 搜文档 感觉这样效率很低
所以这个help file 就是为了我方便随时查的 因为直接 :h {variable name}即可

cmake_variables                             *memo-cmake*
some essential cmake variables.

g:memo_cmake_current_source_dir             *g:memo_cmake_current_source_dir*
  `The path to the source directory currently being processed.`
  This the full path to the source directory that 
  is currently being processed by cmake.

g:memo_cmake_current_binary_dir             *g:memo_cmake_current_binary_dir*
  `The path to the binary directory currently being processed.`
  This the full path to the build directory that is currently being processed by
  cmake. Each directory added by add_subdirectory() 
  will create a binary directory in the build tree, 
  and as it is being processed this variable will be set.
  For in-source builds this is the current source directory being processed.

g:memo_cmake_source_dir                     *g:memo_cmake_source_dir*
  `The path to the top level of the source tree.`
  This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake source tree.
  For an in-source build, this would be the same as CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.

g:memo_cmake_binary_dir                     *g:memo_cmake_binary_dir*
  `The path to the top level of the build tree.`
  This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake build tree.
  For an in-source build, this would be the same as CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.

g:memo_project_binary_dir                   *g:memo_project_binary_dir*
  `Full path to build directory for project.`
  This is the binary directory of the most recent project() command.

g:memo_project_source_dir                   *g:memo_project_source_dir*
  `Top level source directory for the current project.`
  This is the source directory of the most recent project() command.

g:memo_pass_regular_expression              *g:memo_pass_regular_expression*
  `The output must match this regular expression for the test to pass.`
  If set, the test output will be checked against the specified 
  regular expressions and at least one of the regular expressions 
  has to match, otherwise the test will fail.
