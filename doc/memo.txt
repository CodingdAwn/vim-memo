*memo.txt* 很多时候总是忘记一些变量的意思 
我就需要打开对应的官网 搜文档 感觉这样效率很低
所以这个help file 就是为了我方便随时查的 因为直接 :h {variable name}即可

cmake_variables                             *memo-cmake*
some essential cmake variables.

g:memo_cmake_current_source_dir             *g:memo_cmake_current_source_dir*
  `The path to the source directory currently being processed.`
  This the full path to the source directory that 
  is currently being processed by cmake.

g:memo_cmake_current_binary_dir             *g:memo_cmake_current_binary_dir*
  `The path to the binary directory currently being processed.`
  This the full path to the build directory that is currently being processed by
  cmake. Each directory added by add_subdirectory() 
  will create a binary directory in the build tree, 
  and as it is being processed this variable will be set.
  For in-source builds this is the current source directory being processed.

g:memo_cmake_source_dir                     *g:memo_cmake_source_dir*
  `The path to the top level of the source tree.`
  This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake source tree.
  For an in-source build, this would be the same as CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.

g:memo_cmake_binary_dir                     *g:memo_cmake_binary_dir*
  `The path to the top level of the build tree.`
  This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake build tree.
  For an in-source build, this would be the same as CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.

g:memo_project_binary_dir                   *g:memo_project_binary_dir*
  `Full path to build directory for project.`
  This is the binary directory of the most recent project() command.

g:memo_project_source_dir                   *g:memo_project_source_dir*
  `Top level source directory for the current project.`
  This is the source directory of the most recent project() command.

g:memo_pass_regular_expression              *g:memo_pass_regular_expression*
  `The output must match this regular expression for the test to pass.`
  If set, the test output will be checked against the specified 
  regular expressions and at least one of the regular expressions 
  has to match, otherwise the test will fail. 

g:memo_position_independent_code            *g:memo_position_independent_code*
  `Whether to create a position-independent target`
  The POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property determines whether
  position independent `executables` or `shared libraries` will be created.
  This property is True by {default} for {SHARED} and {MODULE} library targets and False otherwise.
  This property is initialized by the value of the 
  {CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE} variable if it is set when a target is created.

g:memo_cmake_install_prefix                 *g:memo_cmake_install_prefix*
  cmake install default dir
  如果是自己指定的安装目录 如果需要找lib文件的话 unix需要指定ld要找的目录
  ld.so.conf.d下是所有会遍历寻找的目录 需要执行ldconfig来重新加载配置
  或者使用LD_LIBRARY_PATH来指定ld的目录

g:memo_cmake_windows_export_all_symbols     *g:memo_cmake_windows_export_all_symbols*
  如果是在windows下的话 不设置这个 在找dll的时候 他会去找lib 而不是dll
